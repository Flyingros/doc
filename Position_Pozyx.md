POZYX
==============

Pozyx.io is a Decawave (DWM1000) based system to locate anything in 3D via UWB (Ultra-wide band).

It is 135$ per sensor (anchor or tag) and for 3D positionning you need AT LEAST 4 anchors and 1 tag for at least 400$. Which is 599â‚¬ for the pack.

If you want to make a sensor with the position only (no incorporated IMU), it will cost about 5 Arduinos clones, one PCB (dirty PCB) and 25$ DWM1000 chip for about 160$ for the whole product.
