Installation
-------------

Flyingros\_web depends on Rosbridge\_server, which can be installed via the packages `ros-indigo-rosbridge-*`

To build the website, you need NodeJS, NPM and gulp. This is as a dependency for the simplicity of development. Once compiled, while you don't change the source, you can simply use the dist generated folder.

Then go into the `www` folder.

´´´
    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
    sudo apt-get install npm
    npm install -g gulp
    npm install
    gulp build 
    # or simply gulp to develop 
´´´

The output is in the `dist` folder. Open `index.html` in your browser.
